# Personal Portfolio Website

A full-stack personal portfolio website designed to showcase my **skills, experience, and projects**, along with a **technical blog section**.

The blog system dynamically loads articles written in **Markdown (`.md`) files**, allowing easy content creation and maintenance without modifying the frontend code. Each blog post is rendered on the website with proper formatting.
